# AR Paint - Augmented Reality Paint
A program developed to the PSR course of University of Aveiro which allows to draw with a object using a webcam by detecting the object's color.


## Description

This is a program  allows the user draw on a canvas with an object using a webcam to track it's centroid, can  display a puzzle to the user, with different levels of difficulty and give a score, can prevent against agressive shakes,can also draw shapes like squares, elipses and circles.
There's also the possibility to display the current painting on the camera window.

#### Calibration tool
The program has calibration tool( color_segmenter.py) that allows to filter the color of the webcam in order to track the object. 
The user can also use the mouse and by clicking it will automatically ajust the filter of color on the pixel he click.

It will write a json file, which the main will read and identify the object by the color.
Also when starting, the script's trackbars will be set at the position of the previous calibration. If there are no prior calibrations, the script uses default values.

This script should be run atleast once before executing the main program, to set a color for tracking.

####Canvas

This would be the most basic mode to run this program, its supposed to emulate a simplified version of paint, nothing more.

#### Puzzle
The gamemode puzzle generate a random pattern, that the user must fill the blank spaces with the right color, then gets an evaluation about the score points doing the puzzle.
The score points system you start with 0%, when painting the right space you gain score points, when you paint the wrong color you lose score points. If you fill the right color in the right spaces you get 100% score points.

Also the user can choose the difficulty by increasing the number of lines generated by the programm.

It comes also with a trackbar of the sensibility of use shake prevention(usp), so the user can define more or less shake prevention

#### Polygon drawing

The user can draw squares, circles or elipses on the white board. To draw any shape the user needs to press the corresponding shape key ('p','e','o),then click MRB on the final position or move the object on the camera to alter the shape geometry and press the key again to finish drawing the shape.


#### Drawing on camera

Beside the user can draw on the white board, the user can also draw on the webcam that is using to track the centroide, by using the key 'v'.


#### Use shake prevention
The user can call this function to prevent getting a line drawed if the object doesn't get detected then appears in a diferent far away localization. The user can use the mouse to create point and test if the function its working

```bash
main.py -j limits.json -usp 
```


# Installation

#### Requirements: 

To run the program you need this installed:
- Argparse
- OpenCv
- Numpy
- Partial from functools
- Deepcopy
- Pick
- Json
- Collections

``` bash

```

## How to run

To run the program you must navite on the terminal to the remote repository path, then you can type "-h" to get the information about all the comammds

```bash
main.py -h 
```
#### To start the main program 

```bash
main.py -j limits.json
```
 Then choose the game mode, canvas drawing or puzzle
